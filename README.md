# TTK-91

TTK-91 is a assembly-like language made for a Computer organization course in Helsinki University. 
The course used this language to teach how programming languages work, how code is compiled into machine language from a basic assembly-like language.

This is my take on writing the compiler. The main implementation is in C. The other ones are previous attempts when I hadn't read up on compiler design.
