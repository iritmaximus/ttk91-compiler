# TTK-91

TTK-91 is a assembly-like language made for a Computer organization course in Helsinki University. 
The course used this language to teach how programming languages work, how code is compiled into machine language from a basic assembly-like language.
This language is now retiring and as a tribute, I thought I would write a proper CLI compiler for the language in Haskell.
